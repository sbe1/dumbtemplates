Dumbtemplates
==============

Super simple "dumb" templating system for Java that exploits the wonderfully simple org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor class.
Edit your dumbtemplate.properties file to point to your .html template files (template files must have an .html extension)
and use Dumbtemplates convenience methods to roll your own MVC framework. While Dumbtemplates is dead simple, it also supports
auto-reloading of your templates when new files are uploaded or existing files are updated.

Dumbtemplates is super lightweight and efficient and assumes you know what you're doing.

For more info on org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor, see

See the Javadoc for more info on using Dumbtemplates.
